 * Custom RentalNotAllowedException class. Used to make Exceptions clearer.
 * <p>
 * In the context of this library management system, a RentalNotAllowedException could be useful in several scenarios. For instance:
 * <p>
 * If a user attempts to rent an item that's already rented out.
 * If a user attempts to rent more items than allowed by the system.
 * If a user tries to rent an item but they have unpaid late fees or other issues.
